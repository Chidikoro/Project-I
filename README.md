# Project-I
Simulated Login
Frontend Project (Simulating a login process)
For this project, I simulated a login process for a
normal website. The user flow is as follows.
• A user searches your site by inputting the link on the search bar, and is
greeted by your lovely homepage.
• The user sees a homepage containing two buttons (Home and Login).
• The user clicks on the login, and is directed to a page, with two form inputs
(email address and password).
• The user inputs their login credentials (eg: email: uobis@gmail.com, password:
12345678) if it is wrog, the user is shown an error message saying they have inputted the
wrong credentials.
• Once the user inputs their correct credentials (eg: email: dan@gmail.com,
password: password1) and they are logged in successfully, they get redirected to
a simple page named Dashboard.
